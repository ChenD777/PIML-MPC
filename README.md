"Physics-informed model predictive control for intelligent operation of edge datacenters"

‚ö°Ô∏è This work presents a novel physics-informed machine learning-based MPC (PIML-MPC) framework that reduces cooling energy consumption in edge data centers (EDCs) while maintaining robust thermal regulation‚Äîeven under unseen operating conditions.



Edge data centers (EDCs) support latency-sensitive applications but consume significant energy, particularly in cooling systems. While Model Predictive Control (MPC) enhanced with AI has shown promise, black-box models struggle with generalization and depend heavily on large, high-quality datasets. To overcome this, we propose a Physics-Informed Machine Learning-based MPC (PIML-MPC) framework. By embedding domain-specific physical knowledge into neural network models, our approach improves generalization and reduces data dependency.

‚úÖ Key Results:

(1) 11.5% energy savings over a baseline under standard conditions

(2) 5.3% additional savings under unseen high heat loads, with no thermal performance degradation

(3) Outperforms three existing ML-based MPC methods in both energy efficiency and thermal control
